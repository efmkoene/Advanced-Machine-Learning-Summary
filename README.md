# Advanced-Machine-Learning-Summary
An incomplete summary of things covered in the Advanced Machine Learning Course at the ETH ZÃ¼rich, 2018-2019. I wrote a syllabus for myself to study the material. The exam happened before I was finished, but I want to finish the summary for myself still; perhaps it is useful for others!
